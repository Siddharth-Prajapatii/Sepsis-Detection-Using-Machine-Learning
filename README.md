# Sepsis-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning


Our goal is to predict early detection of sepsis using physiological data.The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and we aim to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis.Here we are going to use Sklearn , Keras and Basics Machine Learning Libraries of Python.



# Python Libraries Used 

 Pandas

 Numpy

 Keras

 Sklearn

 Matplotlib
 
 And Many More
